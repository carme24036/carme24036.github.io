The game is called "Love Bomb" and it is a cute arcade-style game designed with a girly aesthetic and inspired by valentines day, where you play as a pink circle trying to collect falling hearts while avoiding bombs. 

You move left or right using the arrow keys. You have to catch 10 hearts to win the game, but if you accidentally touch a falling bomb, it's game over. The hearts and bombs fall from the top of the screen.
