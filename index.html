                              Hello! Welcome to my portfolio where I document my acheievements and projects.
                              My name is Carmen, and I live in Pennsylvania, USA.</li>
                         <br>
                         <li> 
                              I am an undergraduate student at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology. I am pursuing a
                              bachelor's degree in Interactive Media, focusing on User Experience Design. I am 19 years old and
                              previously attended York County School of Technology, a vocational high school, where I specialized in
                              Computer Programming. I am fluent in both English and Spanish.</li>
                         </li>

                         <li> 
                              My dream job is to be a UX Designer and design apps or websites. I have always been someone who enjoys
                              art and design, and I also have a passion for technology and computers. Combining these two interests,
                              I believe that a career in UX Design would be a perfect fit for me.

                    RoboDog</h3>
               <p>
                    Over the past few months, I, as well as some other students, have been working on the class' Robot
                    Dogs. We named the project RoboDog.
                    Recently, however, I have taken over the development of the dogs.
               </p>

               <ul class="robodogList">
                    <li>
                         The original idea was to program an Alexa speaker to use ChatGPT to give the dogs commands, but we 
                         realized that the dog has its own speakers  and microphone and no longer need Alexa. Now, the goal is 
                         to use the dogs' built-in speakers and microphone to create a speech to text program in which the dog can 
                         interpret words and turn that into code that it can run. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>   
                         So far, I have created a program that uses an OpenAi API to have a user input information and get a
                         response from the API, similar to ChatGPT. I am using the program to give the RoboDog commands. However, 
                         this is only the first step in the development of the dog. The next step in the development of this project
                         is to figure out how to get access to the microphone and speaker of the dog so it can be linked with a 
                         speech-to-text/text-to-speech program.
