                    Summary
               </p>
               <p>
                    I am a high school senior currently attending York County School of Technology, which is a vocational high school. My shop area is Computer Programming.
                    I am 17 years old and have two siblings. One of them attends this school as well. I am hispanic and fluent in both English and Spanish.
                    <br><br>In the future, I would like to be a web designer, as I enjoy making and designing web pages, this portfolio being one. I plan to go to college and 
                    get a bachelor's degree in order to make that happen.

               <p>
                    Over the past few months, I, as well as some other students, have been working on the class Robot Dogs, which we named RoboDog. 
                    Recently, I have taken over the development of the dogs. 
               </p>

                    <ul>
                         <li>I have created a program that uses an openai API to have a user input information and get a response from
                              the API, similar to ChatGPT. For the RoboDog, I am using the program to give the RoboDog commands. However, 
                              this is only the first step in the development of the dog. The long-term goal is to use voice to verbally command 
                              the dog by using speech-to-text technology. 
                         </li>
                    </ul>
