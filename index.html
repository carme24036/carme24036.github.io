               <p>
                    I am a high school senior currently attending York County School of Technology, which is a
                    vocational high school. My shop area is Computer Programming. I am 17 years old and have two siblings. 
                    I am hispanic and fluent in both English and Spanish.
                    <br><br>
                    In the future, I would like to be a web designer, as I enjoy making and designing web pages, this
                    portfolio being one. I plan to go to college and get a bachelor's degree in either graphic design 
                    or computer science in order to make that happen.

                    RoboDog</h3>
               <p>
                    Over the past few months, I, as well as some other students, have been working on the class' Robot
                    Dogs. We named the project RoboDog.
                    Recently, however, I have taken over the development of the dogs.
               </p>

               <ul class="robodogList">
                    <li>
                         The original idea was to program an Alexa speaker to use ChatGPT to give the dogs commands, but we 
                         realized that the dog has its own speakers  and microphone and no longer need Alexa. Now, the goal is 
                         to use the dogs' built-in speakers and microphone to create a speech to text program in which the dog can 
                         interpret words and turn that into code that it can run. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>   
                         So far, I have created a program that uses an OpenAi API to have a user input information and get a
                         response from the API, similar to ChatGPT. I am using the program to give the RoboDog commands. However, 
                         this is only the first step in the development of the dog. The next step in the development of this project
                         is to figure out how to get access to the microphone and speaker of the dog so it can be linked with a 
                         speech-to-text/text-to-speech program.
